       "'The dishes that comprise \"Singaporean Chinese cuisine\" today were originally brought to Singapore by the early southern Chinese immigrants (Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese). They were then adapted to suit the local availability of ingredients, while absorbing influences from Malay, Indian and other cooking traditions.\\nMost of the names of Singaporean Chinese dishes were derived from dialects of southern China, Hokkien (Min Nan) being the most common. As there was no common system for transliterating these dialects into the Latin alphabet, it is common to see different variants on the same name for a single dish. For example, bah kut teh may also be spelt bak kut teh, and char kway tiao may also be spelt char kuay teow.\\n\\nBak kut teh (肉骨茶; ròu gǔ chá), pork rib soup made with a variety of Chinese herbs and spices.\\nBeef kway teow (牛肉粿条; niú ròu guǒ tiáo), flat rice noodles stir-fried with beef, served dry or with soup.\\nBak chang (肉粽; ròu zòng), glutinous rice dumplings, usually filled with pork, mushrooms and stewed egg, steamed in bamboo leaves. Although it is Chinese in origin, it is also a favourite in Peranakan cuisine.\\nBak Chor Mee (肉脞面; roù cuò miàn; \\'minced pork noodles\\'), egg noodles with minced pork, braised mushroom, pork meatball and other ingredients, served dry or in soup. Usually the flat, tape-like mee pok noodle is used.\\nBan mian (板面; bǎn miàn), hand-made flat noodles served with vegetables, minced meat, sliced mushrooms, and an egg in an anchovy-based soup. Noodle variations are common. \"Ban mian\" refers to flat, long noodles; \"mee hoon kuay\" (米粉粿; mí fěn guǒ; \\'rice vermicelli cake\\') refers to flat, rectangular noodles; \"you mian\" (幼面; yòu miàn; \\'thin noodles\\') refers to thin noodles.\\nChai tow kway (菜头粿; cài tóu guǒ), also known as char kway (炒粿; chǎo guǒ) or carrot cake, is a dish of steamed radish/daikon cakes diced and stir-fried with garlic, egg, chopped preserved radish, and sometimes with shrimp. This dish comes in black (fried with sweet dark soy sauce) or white (fried into an omelette) versions, with a chilli paste sometimes added.\\nChar kway teow (炒粿条; chǎo guǒ tiáo), thick, flat rice noodles stir-fried in dark soy sauce with shrimp, eggs, beansprouts, fish cake, cockles, green leafy vegetables, Chinese sausage and fried cubes of lard.\\nChar siu (叉烧; chā shāo), also romanised cha-su, cha siu, cha sio, caa siu and char siew, is barbecued pork in Cantonese cuisine.\\nChicken noodles is an egg noodle dish with diced chicken meat.\\nCrab bee hoon (螃蟹米粉; páng xiè mí fěn) is a rice vermicelli dish served with whole mud crab. It may be served dry or in soup and sometimes in a claypot.\\nDrunken prawns (醉虾; zuì xiā), prawns cooked with rice wine.\\nDuck rice (鸭饭; yā fàn), braised duck served with rice cooked with yam and shrimp. It can be served simply with white rice and a thick dark sauce, or with braised hard-boiled eggs, preserved salted vegetables, and hard bean curd (tau kua) on the side. Teochew boneless duck rice is a similar, but a more refined dish. The duck is deboned and sliced thinly, allowing the sauces to seep into the meat. Roasted duck rice is also commonly sold.\\nFish ball noodles (鱼丸面; yú wán miàn), similar to bak chor mee, except that fish balls are used instead of minced pork.\\nFish soup bee hoon (鱼片米粉; yú piàn mí fěn) is a Singaporean soup-based served hot with bee hoon.\\nFrog Leg porridge (田鸡粥; tían jī zhōu) is served with frog legs, scallion, ginger and thick black sauce in a claypot with porridge in another claypot.\\nHae mee (虾面; xiā miàn), stir-fried prawn noodles cooked in a broth made from prawn heads and pork bones, topped with ingredients such as prawns, sliced pork belly, squid, egg, lard, and served with sambal chilli and lime at the side.\\nHainanese chicken rice (海南鸡饭; Hǎinán jī fàn) is based on the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken. It is considered Singapore\\'s national dish.\\nHainanese curry rice is a dish consisting of steamed white rice smothered in a mess of curries and braised gravy.\\nHar cheong gai (虾酱鸡; xiā jiàng jī; \\'shrimp paste chicken\\'), chicken wings fried in a batter with fermented shrimp paste.\\nHokkien mee (福建面; Fújiàn miàn), egg noodles and rice noodles stir-fried with egg, slices of pork, prawns and squid, and served and garnished with spring onion, lard, sambal chilli and lime (for adding lime juice to the dish).\\nHum chim peng (咸煎饼; xián jiān bǐng), a deep-fried bun-like pastry sometimes filled with bean paste.\\nKaya toast, a traditional breakfast dish.
